            <h1>Gray Whale Feeding</h1>
            <p>
                To feed, a grey whale dives to the bottom and turns on its side. There it 
                bites chunks out of the mud or sand. Also stirred up are the buried small 
                shrimp-like animals. The whale sucks this water mixture into its mouth. 
                Forcing the water through the baleen strains out the animals.

                Gray whales actually seem to eat a variety of foods. Besides bottom 
                animals, they sometimes feed on plankton. Other times they even strain 
                seaweeds through their mouths to rub off crabs and shrimp. Scientists 
                think their flexable feeding behavoir is important for their survival. It may 
                have helped them recover quickly from near extinction. Other whales 
                which eat fewer kinds of food have been slower to increase in numbers
