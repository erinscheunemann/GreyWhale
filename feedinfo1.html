            <h1>Gray Whale Feeding</h1>
            <p>
                Gray whales are huge animals. They grow
                to about 49 feet long and weigh about
                90,000 pounds. It takes a lot of food
                to grow to that size. It also takes a
                lot of food for a full-grown whale to
                stay healthy.
            </p>
            <p>
                To feed, a gray whale dives to the bottom and turns on its side. There it 
                bites chunks out of the mud or sand. The buried small shrimp-like animals
                are stirred up into the water. The whale sucks this water mixture into its mouth. 
                Forcing the water through through baleen
                plates strains out the animals.

                Baleen is made from the same protein as
                your fingernails. The plates of baleen
                are connected to the gray whale's
                mouth. A baleen plate has long bristles
                that filter food from the sea water.

                Gray whales actually seem to eat a variety of foods. Besides bottom 
                animals, they sometimes feed on plankton. Other times they even strain 
                seaweeds through their mouths to rub off crabs and shrimp. Scientists 
                think their flexable feeding behavoir is important for their survival. It may 
                have helped them recover quickly from near extinction. Other whales 
                which eat fewer kinds of food have been slower to increase in numbers
