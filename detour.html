            <h1>Why Detour?</h1>
            <p>
                Just why gray whales make detours is a subject of active research 
                among scientists. A detour poses risks. In harbors, detouring whales 
                face more interactions with vessels and with curious humans. Whales 
                may be injured by these encounters. They may also become trapped in 
                shallow water and die. Why take the risk?
            </p>
            <p>
                At least for Puget Sound, the reason seems to be food. Changing conditions 
                in the Arctic have reduced the food available to gray whales in their 
                normal feeding grounds. The whales that enter and feed in Puget Sound 
                have survived two “ high mortality events”.  A high mortality event is 
                a serious decrease in the overall gray whale population. Entering Puget 
                Sound to feed looks like a successful strategy for staying alive.
