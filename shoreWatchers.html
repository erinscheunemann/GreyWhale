            <p>
                Migrating gray whales can often be seen from the seaside. You
                can easily learn the technique. Look close to shore and scan
                your eyes slowly from left to right across the horizon. Watch for
                anything that breaks the surface of the ocean water. Focus on
                those objects and look for movement. Then look for spray from
                the blowhole and splash from tails.

            <p>Whale Watching from shore has <strong>no effect</strong> on migrating whales.</p>
