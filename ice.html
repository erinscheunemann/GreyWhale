                    You have spent too much time feeding in preparation for your 
                    migration and have been trapped by the advancing ice. Rescue 
                    efforts are underway, but will <strong>cost you 21 days</strong> of time.

                    Getting stuck in the ice is a danger but so is not
                    having enough ice. The ice pack is important for
                    the plants and animals that gray whales eat.
