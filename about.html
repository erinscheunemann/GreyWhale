                            The migration of the California gray whale is a remarkable 
                            journey. Gray whales swim from Mexico to the Arctic and 
                            back each year. The trip covers some 22,000 kilometers 
                            (14,000 miles).

                            Gray whales were once hunted to near
                            extinction. Protected from hunting in
                            1947, they were removed from the
                            Endangered Species Act list in 1994.

                            All seemed well until about 2019. Since
                            then hundreds of gray whales have
                            washed up dead on the beaches from
                            Alaska to Mexico. Most of the dead
                            whales were skinny and malnourished.

                            What kinds of situations do gray whales
                            encounter on their long trip that might
                            help explain the death of these whales? 
                        </p><br>
                        <p>
                            "Electronic Whale" is a computer simulation of half of the gray whale's 
                            trip. A computer simulation "models" or represents real 
                            life. In this simulation, you will experience some of the 
                            things that a gray whale faces on its migration. You will 
                            also choose how your whale responds to what it meets. 
                            This means that no two runs of the simulation will be 
                            exactly alike.
                        </p><br>
                        <p>
                            The object of this simulation is to get your whale to the 
                            lagoon before a 90 day time limit expires. The 90-day limit 
                            represents the three-month migration.
