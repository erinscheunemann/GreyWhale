                            The migration of the California gray whale is a remarkable 
                            journey. Gray whales swim from Mexico to the Arctic and 
                            back each year. The trip covers some 22,000 kilometers 
                            (14,000 miles).

                            "Electronic Whale" is a computer simulation of half of this 
                            trip. A computer simulation "models" or represents real 
                            life. In this simulation, you will experience some of the 
                            things that a gray whale faces on its migration. You will 
                            also choose how your whale responds to what it meets. 
                            This means that no two runs of the simulation will be 
                            exactly alike.

                            The object of this simulation is to get your whale to the 
                            lagoon before a 90 day time limit expires. The 90-day limit 
                            represents the three-month migration.
