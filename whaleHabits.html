            <h1>Killer Whale Feeding Habits</h1>
            <p>
                Found in all the oceans of the world, the killer whale is a fierce hunter. It 
                hunts in packs, and cooperates in attacking its prey in much the same way that 
                wolves do.

                Its diet consists of sea lions, elephant seals, porpoises, squid, sharks, fish, 
                penguins, and smaller whales. While it is known to attack very large whales, 
                successful attacks on large whales are probably limited to sick or wounded 
                whales. No case of its attacking a human has ever been documented. The name 
                "killer whale" is grdually being replaced by "orca", its less hostile sounding 
                scientific name.

                The male killer whale can grow as large as 32 feet (9.6 m) long, and weigh 8 
                or 9 tons. The female can reach 23 feet (8.2 m) in length, and weigh 4 tons. 
                The mouth of the killer whale is large and well adapted for hunting. It has 46 
                to 50 cone-shaped teeth. The teeth point backwards and inwards and 
                interlock. This arrangement aids in gripping large prey and in tearing larger 
                animals into bite-sized pieces.

            <br>
            <p>Grey whales are of interest to killer whales about 20 percent of the time they 
                encounter eachother. Killer whales are successful in about 33 percent of their 
                attacks.
