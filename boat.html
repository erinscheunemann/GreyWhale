            <h1>Encounter With Fishing Boats</h1>
            <p>You have encountered a fishing boat and its nets in the water.</p>
            <p>
                Gray whales are at high risk of becoming entangled in fishing gear.
                Entangled whales may drag and swim with attached gear for long
                distances. Swimming while dragging fishing gear tires the whale.
                Sometimes they are unable to swim at all. The gear may make it
                difficult to eat. Entanglement can also cause severe injury, which
                may lead to death.
            </p>
            <p>Getting safely around the nets requires you to change your course.</p>
