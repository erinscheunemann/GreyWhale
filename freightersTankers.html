            <h1>Encounter With Freighters and Tankers</h1>
            <p>You have encountered a large vessel in the shipping lanes.</p>
            <p>Large ships are one of the deadliest threats whales face.</p>
            <p>
                Large ships take time to change course.
                Sometimes they can't change in time to
                avoid colliding with a gray whale. The
                whale can be injured or killed.
            </p>
            <p>
                Collisions with large vessels often go
                unnoticed and unreported. Gray whale
                deaths probably range from the tens to
                the hundreds each year.
