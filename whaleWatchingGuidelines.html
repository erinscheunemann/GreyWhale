                    Active whales require ample space. In all
                    cases, do not restrict normal movement or
                    behavior of whales, or take actions that
                    may evoke a reaction from whales or
                    result in physical contact with a whale.

                    To protect whales and avoid harassment of
                    whales, NOAA Fisheries provided the
                    following guidelines that may be applied
                    to all whale watching.

                            <li>Avoid excessive speed or sudden changes in speed or direction.</li>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Approach stationary whales at no more than idle or &quot;no wake&quot; speed.</li>
                            <li>Parallel the course and speed of moving whales.</li>
                            <li>Do not attempt a head-on approach to moving or resting whales.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li><br>
                    <li>
                        <p>NO INTENTIONAL APPROACH (less than 100 feet away):</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Do not intentionally approach within 100 feet of whales.</li>
                            <li>
                                If whales approach within 100 feet of
                                your vessel, put engine in neutral and
                                do not re-engage props until whales
                                are observed at the surface, clear of
                                the vessel.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ol><br>
                <p>
                    Active whales require ample space. Breaching, lobtailing, and 
                    flipper-slapping whales may endanger people and/or vessels. 
                    Feeding whales often emit subsurface bubbles before rising to 
                    feed at the surface. Stand clear of light green bubble patches. 
                    In all cases, do not restrict normal movement or behavior of whales, 
                    or take actions that may evoke a reaction from whales or result in 
                    physical contact with a whale.
                </p><br>
                <p>
                    Diving on whales is considered to be an intentional approach of 
                    whales and may be considered a violation of federal law.
