                <h1>Congratulations! You've Made It.</h1>
                <p>
                    You've swum over 11,000 kilometers. You've faced storms, 
                    killer whales and other hazards. Now, you've entered the 
                    glassy calm of the lagoon. Your journey is over, for now...
                </p>

            <div id="pass" style="display: none;">
                <h1>Sorry, You Didn't Make It</h1>
                <p>
                    Your California gray whale must make it to the lagoons within 90
                     days to be successful in this simulation. Take heart, however, 
                     in reality, gray whales have given birth all along the migration
                      route. So, while other places aren't as hospitable as the lagoons, 
                      they sometimes do in a pinch!

                <h1>You Have Been Killed</h1>
                <p>
                    Scientists estimate that gray whales are attacked by killer whales 
                    in 20 percent of their encounters. Killer whales are 
                    successful in 33 percent of their attacks.

                <h1>You Have Suffocated</h1>
                <p>
                    Your gray whale was unable to escape the fishing net in 
                    time and suffocated. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Your gray whale was hit by the ship and died. 
                </p>
                <p>You have not survived your migration. You can start again or quit.</p>

                <p>
                    In your quest to find nutrients on your way too your destination, you spent a little too much time 
                    living the lush, or in your case not so lush, life in your chosen detour. You have passed away.
