                            You have encountered a pod of killer whales. 
                            You need to make a decision to avoid them, 
                            ignore them, or investigate the pod of killer whales.

                            Remember, gray whales are bigâ€¦ but so are killer whales. 
                            Male killer whales can grow as large as 32 feet long, and 
                            weigh 9 tons. They are the gray whale's main predator.
                        </p><br>
                        <p>
                            Killer whales hunt in packs. Like wolves, they cooperate in attacking their prey.
                        </p><br>
                        <p>
                            Killer whales usually attack gray whale calves. Recently, 
                            killer whales have been seen attacking adult gray whales. 
                        </p><br>
                        <p>
                            Killer whales have also been spotted inside the gray whale breeding 
                            lagoons in Mexico.  These are the first sightings since Charles 
                            Scammon's discovery of the lagoons. 
                        </p><br>
                        <p>
                            Both of these unusual events have alarmed scientists.
