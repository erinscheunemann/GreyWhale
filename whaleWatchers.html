            <h1>Encounter With Whale Watchers</h1>
            <p>
                Whale watching is an important business
                in many spots along the coast from Alaska
                to the lagoons of northern Mexico. These
                activities can increase boat noise and
                human interactions for nearby whales.
            </p>
            <p>
                Whale watching along the migration route
                may disturb the whales and affect their
                behavior. Sometimes gray whales change
                course and alter their swimming speed and
                respiratory patterns when followed by
                whale watching boats.
