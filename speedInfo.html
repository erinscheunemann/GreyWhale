            <h1>About Whale Swimming Speeds</h1>
            <p>
                Most Migrating gray whales swim 24 hours per day. Although 
                the speed may vary, it falls between 4 and 12 kilometers per 
                hour.
            </p>
            <p>
                Occasionally a gray whale is observed sleeping near shore, but 
                this is the exception rather than the rule.
            </p>
            <p>In this simulation we are not including the sleeping behavior.</p>
            <p>
                Some whales are faster swimmers than gray whales, others are 
                slower. For example:
