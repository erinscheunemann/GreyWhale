            <h1>Summer in the Artic</h1>
            <p>Just what is a self-respecting whale doing in the cold artic waters?</p><br>
            <p>
                Polar regions are rich in whale food. The long days and abundant sunlight 
                of the summer favor phytoplankton growth. During this time, cold water from 
                the bottom moves up toward the surface. The cold water is full of the 
                nutrients plankton need to grow. Lots of nutrients, lots of light cause a 
                rapid increase in plankton numbers; the plankton "blooms".
            </p><br>
            <p>There are lots of these tiny plants available to be eaten. As a result, 
                zooplankton populations also explode. Other animal populations, including 
                the bottom dwellers, also increase. These populations of bottom dwellers 
                provide food for California gray whales.
            </p><br>
            <p>
                So, grey whales spend their summers in cold arctic waters because so 
                much food is available.
            </p><br>
            <p>
                Shorter days and falling temperatures signal that it is time for the whales 
                to stop feeding. They turn south and begin their great swim.
