# Grey Whale Simulation
The Grey Whale Simulation is a educational video game meant to show students what the California Grey Whale's migration is like and what obstacles the whales may face on their journey. The simulation was originally created in the 90's by FORSEA and is being converted into a web-friendly format \(with additional features!\) using HTML, JS, and CSS by me!! ^_^

The simulation as described on the [FORSEA](http://www.forsea.org) website:

>“The Electronic Whale” is a series of lessons accompanied by a computer simulation of the remarkable migration of the California gray whale. Each year, gray whales swim from Mexico to the Arctic and back in a trip covering some 22,000 kilometers or 14,000 miles.
>
>The computer simulation models events in the gray whale’s life as students try to get their whales from the Arctic to the warm waters of Mexican Lagoons before the three-month migration period ends. Players experience some of the things that a gray whale faces on its migration and choose how their whales respond to what they meet. Ample life history and ecological information assure that each migration simulation adds to your students’ knowledge of the marine environment while the variety of events encountered and the choices made mean that no two runs of simulation will be exactly alike.
