            <p>
                Gray whales actually seem to eat a variety of foods. However, most 
                scientists agree that whales feed very little during migration. They are 
                known to stop to eat squid and to investigate other potential food.
            </p>
            <p>
                Scientists think the flexable feeding behavoir of the grey whale is 
                important for their survival. It may have helped them recover quickly 
                from near extinction. Other whales which eat fewer kinds of food have 
                been slower to increase in numbers.
            </p>
            <p>
                To feed, a grey whale dives to the bottom and turns on its side. There it 
                bites chunks out of the mud or sand. Also stirred up are the buried small 
                shrimp-like animals. The whale sucks this water mixture into its mouth. 
                Forcing the water through the baleen strains out the animals.
