            <h1>Feeding During the Journey</h1>
            <p>
                Most scientists agree that most gray
                whales feed very little during migration. They are 
                known to stop to eat squid and to investigate other potential food.
            </p>
            <p>
                Gray whales actually seem to eat a
                variety of foods. 
                Scientists think the flexible feeding behavior of the gray whale is 
                important for their survival. It may have helped them recover quickly 
                from near extinction. Other whales which eat fewer kinds of food have 
                been slower to increase in numbers.
            </p>
            <p>
                A grey whale dives to the bottom and turns on its side to feed. There it 
                bites chunks out of the mud or sand. The buried small shrimp-like animals
                are stirred up into the water. The whale sucks this water mixture into its mouth. 
                Forcing the water through through baleen
                plates strains out the animals.
